## Projects
### Senior Design Project: Magnetoelectric Materials for Wireless Power Transfer (_January - May 2024_)
- Final, capstone project for electrical engineering curriculum
- Faculty-supported research on magnetoelectric materials for use in wireless power transfer to implanted medical devices
- Focused on simulation, fabrication, and testing of magnetoelectric structures

### Autonomous Robots Final Project (_January - May 2024_)
University of Florida | EEL4930 Autonomous Robots
- EEL4930 is a special topics course focusing on design principals of autonomous robots using ROS/ROS2
- Using the open-source platform TurtleBot, our team will implement a board game-playing robot!

### Undergraduate Research Assistant: SSTDR Applications for Solar Grid Fault Detection (_August 2021 - May 2024_)
University of Florida | SmartDATA Lab | Funded by the US Department of Energy
- This project focused on using Spread-spectrum Time-domain Reflectometry ([SSTDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spread-spectrum_time-domain_reflectometry)) to more effectively locate faults in solar grids
- SSTDR data was collected from a photovoltaic setup and two different algorithms- Dynamic Time Warping and the Mellin Transform- were applied to the data
- Statistical analysis was then used to compare the performance of the two algorithms
